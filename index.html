    <h1>Welcome to City Of Naga Cebu!</h1>
    <p>Good-day ladies and gentlemen. Let me introduce you the famous tourist spots at The Industrial Hub of Southern Cebu. City of Naga has a unique way of showing it's beauty to the beloved tourists.
    </p>
  
  <p>Naga is on the coastal highway going south from Cebu City, and often reached by bus from that city's south bus terminal. There are also jeepneys from Cebu or from other towns in the region, and KMK buses that run from SM City Cebu via Cebu South terminal.It is now famous for picture perfect peak and rolling hills and a gorgeous boardwalk that attracts thousands of visitors. Indeed, the city is bound for greatness. City of Naga is located along the southern coast of the Province of Cebu.</p>

      <h2>Pasilong sa Naga</h2>
      <p>You're encourage to come onto this amazing artwork designed by the famous interior designer Kenneth Cobonpue. Pasilong sa Naga, which literally means “to find shade in Naga”, is a park I designed for the city of Naga, south of Cebu. The design is made up of interlocking rings that represent circles of life, nature’s way of taking and giving back to the earth. The rings vary in scale and turn into winding paths, elevated walkways, fountains, benches and rest areas as they loop around the park. 
      </br> </br>
      <b><p>How to get there?</p></b>
      </br>
      By Jeepney:From Colon Street, ride a jeepney with routes 09C/F or 10F/H and drop off at Jollibee Bulacao. From there, take the jeepney with route 44 to reach Naga Boardwalk. Thetr are also #44 jeepneys from CIT University in N. Bacalso.

      </i><h2>Manayon's Peak</h2>
      <p>The greatest escape from stress comes at the top. Having a vast spectacular view, unpolluted air and nature’s sound calms us like no other, which is what this new spot from Naga flaunts and more. Located in Naga, a few kilometers away from the national highway, is a breathtaking mountain of green, Manayon’s Peak. Here you can watch the sunset with your friends and might set up camp for some star gazing. This trail will let you observe rural life away from the city. It’s an easy hike to inhale your much needed breath of fresh air.

      <h2>Boardwalk</h2>
      <p>The City of Naga is not your typical countryside destination. One of Cebu’s biggest festivals, the Dagitab, also known as the Festival of Lights, is celebrated here annually. Itis a hybrid of a relaxing nature park where you can also have a peaceful walk by the sea, giving you a new bayside attraction to do your favorite recreational activities.</p>
      
      <p>It is sometimes called the Naga Baywalk, this large and spacious recreation ground has become known as the City of Naga’s most popular public park. Unlike other nature parks in neighboring cities, Naga Boardwalk is hidden away from the highways and sidewalks. The best part is that there isn’t an entrance fee, which makes giving this place a visit one of the many cheap things to do in Cebu.</p>
  </br>  </br> 
    
       <b><p>How to get there?</p></b>
    
     </br>
       Ride a KMK Bus at SM City Cebu. This will bring you right to the City of Naga. However, you will have to compromise by waiting in line, since there are not that many KMK buses available in Cebu.

You can get off at the Naga Church, which is right across the city’s plaza. The City of Naga Boardwalk is a few meters behind the soccer field at the center of the plaza.

      <h2>Mt. Naupa</h2>
      <p>Mt. Naupa is a mountain with an almost-perfect cone and stands as the highest peak in Naga. It stands at only around 587 meters above sea level. Despite being barely 1000 meters above sea level, the mountain occasionally has a sea of clouds. With Mt. Naupa being one of the most accessible mountains in Cebu, this also makes it the most accessible viewing point to witness a sea of clouds.Mt. Naupa is considered as the 8th highest mountain in Central Visayas but despite that, it is also one of the most recommended mountains to climb because of its easy and straightforward trail. It’s even recommended for beginners because of how easy it is to climb.</p>
  </br>  </br> 

   <b><p>How to get there?</p></b>
BY JEEPNEY:  From Cebu City, take a jeepney going Basak. From Basak, take a jeepney with a route Minglanilla-Naga and inform the driver to drop you off the crossing just before the Boys Town in Minglanilla. Look for a habal2x that will take you to the Cogon chapel near the bakery in the crossing.

BY CAR:  Just search "Cogon Chapel, Naga, Cebu" in Waze or Google Maps. Parking space is available in front of the Cogon Chapel.
